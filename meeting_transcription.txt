[0:00:00 - 0:00:10]: Okay. Oh, I totally forgot to stop granola. So just went through all this. Okay. Whatever.

[0:00:10 - 0:00:20]: Um, they're sorry. I know we started. Hold on. Okay. I'll save my thought. Write comments for ladies.

[0:00:20 - 0:00:30]: Um, oh, by the way, granola, I said no, but granola asked me if I want to share my physical screen as well.

[0:00:30 - 0:00:38]: So I wonder if it's starting to be like looking at the screen and also and not just the transcript.

[0:00:38 - 0:00:44]: Cool. Maybe I should have said yes. Okay.

[0:00:44 - 0:00:52]: So, um, all right.

[0:00:52 - 0:01:00]: So I think both of us were like, or I was definitely more busy this week. So I have that one. Yeah.

[0:01:00 - 0:01:05]: Guys, um, what do you want to do the time of West Bank is the simplest one. Okay.

[0:01:05 - 0:01:18]: Um, so, so basically I had a meeting in Hebrew. And I use time of West, um, which is really similar circle back in granola.

[0:01:18 - 0:01:27]: And what I did get, which was cool. So at the end of the meeting. So here I have my immediate summary.

[0:01:27 - 0:01:32]: Um, but what's here is like if I scroll over here, it actually takes me to the clips.

[0:01:32 - 0:01:33]: Oh, that's very cool.

[0:01:33 - 0:01:39]: Those that want to wanted to like then just see here like I want to see this section.

[0:01:39 - 0:01:48]: And they can again, this meeting wasn't Hebrew. So you see that here. And then like I asked for it to output to be in English. And I did get an automatic in the action items.

[0:01:48 - 0:01:55]: Um, and I took no notes. And there's a transcript also. So here's easy. The transcript here is in Hebrew.

[0:01:55 - 0:02:14]: Um, who was speaking. Um, why the thing is they were errors. Um, that it like, for example, the first time I did it, it said that it didn't work. It doesn't work in Hebrew. And I had said it does work in Hebrew.

[0:02:14 - 0:02:26]: That's like the reason I'm trying it out. Although, um, is that word similar in Hebrew like can and can't like it's an American.

[0:02:26 - 0:02:30]: An event instead of low of it. Like it does. It's very different. The work.

[0:02:30 - 0:02:33]: Yeah. So the thing is that then I got an email from them.

[0:02:33 - 0:02:49]: Because I said they were in accuracies. Right. So I got an email from them to say like, sorry, you had issues. So they basically like regenerate. So add context that I had not put and say what was wrong. And then delete the current summary and then you'll get a new one.

[0:02:49 - 0:02:54]: Um, and so I did that. And this is the second one. And the second one is much more.

[0:02:54 - 0:02:58]: So what context did you add that made it better?

[0:02:58 - 0:03:15]: Um, I said that the main meeting was basically about this, like the investment strategies, because it had a lot. I'm like the type of West conversation and challenges with like integrating it. I was like, that was just like a side.

[0:03:15 - 0:03:21]: That was a small talk. And then the mid this, these were like the main meeting insights.

[0:03:21 - 0:03:26]: And so it did change the. Did you write that as a prompt? Or did you?

[0:03:26 - 0:03:36]: Yeah. And then as a context. So I was like, we meant to discuss. Oh, is there like a context field or no, you just there wasn't. But as you see here, like in the current meeting, we're in.

[0:03:36 - 0:03:39]: Here, like I hadn't had this open.

[0:03:39 - 0:03:41]: Oh, okay.

[0:03:41 - 0:03:53]: And so I didn't give any context when I had the meeting. So I gave some context and then every ran it and it was better. So I guess like the context does really help it.

[0:03:53 - 0:04:00]: But at the same time, we see like, you see here, I actually got a chat now from the court. Then I told her that it works.

[0:04:00 - 0:04:12]: So like there. And see some screen shots like how to override the current summary in here. See add context.

[0:04:12 - 0:04:17]: So even like someone could say like do this spelling differently, but then they completely read does it.

[0:04:17 - 0:04:18]: Okay.

[0:04:18 - 0:04:23]: But to hear like, I don't ever pay super context besides I can take some notes now.

[0:04:23 - 0:04:24]: Yeah.

[0:04:24 - 0:04:30]: So I think it's like a very good thing to make sure that they take a time.

[0:04:30 - 0:04:40]: But it did have some core like basically templates. So like once it had the summary, I was then just able to send.

[0:04:40 - 0:04:43]: We didn't get how to follow up meeting.

[0:04:43 - 0:04:49]: So we took from that like a follow up meeting and put the action items in.

[0:04:49 - 0:04:50]: Which was cool.

[0:04:50 - 0:04:55]: Wait, it sent this automatically. No, it didn't send in a matter of giving. I was able to generate it automatically.

[0:04:55 - 0:05:02]: You know, granola does that too. Yeah, I should actually try it to tell it to send you a message.

[0:05:02 - 0:05:04]: And see what that email was like.

[0:05:04 - 0:05:05]: Yeah.

[0:05:05 - 0:05:07]: So.

[0:05:07 - 0:05:11]: So they just connected to your Gmail or does it just come up with.

[0:05:11 - 0:05:16]: Yeah, just gave me the text and I put it in the email.

[0:05:16 - 0:05:19]: And then what else.

[0:05:19 - 0:05:22]: And then, but I guess time I was worried it's not just about reading notes.

[0:05:22 - 0:05:27]: It is also about connecting it to your files. I could crap you for meetings and stuff like that.

[0:05:27 - 0:05:29]: But that's it. So that's time.

[0:05:29 - 0:05:39]: That's time it was.

[0:05:39 - 0:05:41]: Okay.

[0:05:41 - 0:05:47]: Okay. So then what do we want to talk about next?

[0:05:47 - 0:05:53]: Both of mine were updates on previous projects. I did no new projects.

[0:05:53 - 0:05:54]: So do that.

[0:05:54 - 0:05:58]: You'll see, like, I would call it a new one.

[0:05:58 - 0:06:00]: Okay.

[0:06:00 - 0:06:05]: Do you want to hear about the fail or the success?

[0:06:05 - 0:06:07]: Start maybe with the fail.

[0:06:07 - 0:06:10]: Okay.

[0:06:10 - 0:06:16]: So that is the talking Kate.

[0:06:16 - 0:06:17]: Okay.

[0:06:17 - 0:06:19]: I did try base 44.

[0:06:19 - 0:06:22]: No, I didn't get to it this week.

[0:06:22 - 0:06:24]: I told banner about it though.

[0:06:24 - 0:06:25]: Okay.

[0:06:25 - 0:06:26]: Interesting features.

[0:06:26 - 0:06:27]: Yeah, I think he tried.

[0:06:27 - 0:06:31]: He wanted to create a like iPhone app. It's like it's so complicated.

[0:06:31 - 0:06:34]: Then base where for only does web apps, but he might change to do it.

[0:06:34 - 0:06:36]: What that seems easier.

[0:06:36 - 0:06:39]: I think you probably get to it. It's just he's like a one man show.

[0:06:39 - 0:06:42]: Yeah. I know.

[0:06:42 - 0:06:45]: It is a very different type of coding though.

[0:06:45 - 0:06:49]: Yeah. He did say that like there was a conversation like one of the advantages.

[0:06:49 - 0:06:51]: Right. It's like when I'm doing something now, right?

[0:06:51 - 0:06:54]: Like with my health buddy.

[0:06:54 - 0:06:57]: Creating a believe by myself with users and stuff like that.

[0:06:57 - 0:07:00]: Like I might not be having a secure infrastructure.

[0:07:00 - 0:07:05]: And like his app is set up to make sure that it's already doing it in a secure way.

[0:07:05 - 0:07:08]: Yeah.

[0:07:08 - 0:07:11]: Which as we've learned is actually like a whole thing.

[0:07:11 - 0:07:12]: Yeah.

[0:07:12 - 0:07:19]: I mean, the dev ops part is actually the part that freaks me out the most and that I am most clueless about.

[0:07:19 - 0:07:21]: Because I really have not touched any of that.

[0:07:21 - 0:07:23]: I've touched code before, right?

[0:07:23 - 0:07:26]: So yeah.

[0:07:26 - 0:07:27]: Okay.

[0:07:27 - 0:07:34]: So last time at the end of it, you're like, what if you used an AI agent to go to the app?

[0:07:34 - 0:07:39]: I'm like, I'm like, I'm an agent to go and like open up the website.

[0:07:39 - 0:07:41]: I like fill it out and all the stuff.

[0:07:41 - 0:07:43]: And it was like, okay.

[0:07:43 - 0:07:48]: And I don't know how that would work on my phone, but let's just try it on a computer and see if that works.

[0:07:48 - 0:07:52]: So first of all, I went to chat to BT and was like,

[0:07:52 - 0:07:55]: can you, I was like, I put GBT.

[0:07:55 - 0:07:57]: I can do the task for me.

[0:07:57 - 0:08:00]: And it was like, wait, I can't.

[0:08:00 - 0:08:06]: I can write you code that where it basically will go and navigate through the website and fill it out.

[0:08:06 - 0:08:07]: Okay.

[0:08:07 - 0:08:13]: And then I went to Claude and was like, I can't, but I can write code that will fill it out.

[0:08:13 - 0:08:18]: And both of them actually were like, the thing they would use is something called selenium,

[0:08:18 - 0:08:28]: which actually now I know what the fuck selenium is because that's actually the same library or whatever it's called that I used for property 24 scraping.

[0:08:28 - 0:08:31]: Because it's the same idea it goes on to the website.

[0:08:31 - 0:08:33]: It like does.

[0:08:33 - 0:08:36]: So I was like, okay, I know what selenium is, but I want to see if there's something else.

[0:08:36 - 0:08:42]: So I actually then start like googling around to see if there are other companies that do this.

[0:08:42 - 0:08:43]: Actually didn't write them down.

[0:08:43 - 0:08:44]: And they're making up.

[0:08:44 - 0:08:53]: Is there no such thing as like the GPT operator or cloud operator that they could operate on even asked plot specifically about an operator one.

[0:08:53 - 0:09:06]: And beta and two, it said it doesn't do this sort of thing, which is very confusing because actually when I googled called operator it literally one of the examples was filling out for us.

[0:09:06 - 0:09:11]: So I don't know, but cloud itself told me it can't do it.

[0:09:11 - 0:09:12]: Okay.

[0:09:12 - 0:09:13]: Okay.

[0:09:13 - 0:09:17]: I feel like it probably at least is correct about that.

[0:09:17 - 0:09:21]: So then I did though like go and look to see like.

[0:09:21 - 0:09:26]: Oh, and then I did look on like GPT like on chat to see you know how they're those GPT's.

[0:09:26 - 0:09:28]: Yeah, they try to look for like form fillers.

[0:09:28 - 0:09:30]: And there also are none.

[0:09:30 - 0:09:37]: There was one online form filler that got very low ratings and everything else was actually a PDF filler.

[0:09:37 - 0:09:38]: Okay.

[0:09:38 - 0:09:40]: And yeah.

[0:09:40 - 0:09:54]: And then I went online and I searched for stuff and there are a couple of companies actually not that many, but a couple of different companies that do this sort of thing online form fill.

[0:09:54 - 0:10:00]: And basically all of them were like, yes, you could build it using selenium.

[0:10:00 - 0:10:06]: But we make it a lot easier and then you don't have to write code and I was like, oh, you're using play anyway.

[0:10:06 - 0:10:19]: And all of them also were like more enterprise software or like create an API that you can like it was not like an easy thing that I could try as a tool.

[0:10:19 - 0:10:21]: It seemed like.

[0:10:21 - 0:10:27]: And you had to like go and ask how much it costs or like get on a wait list or speak to someone for a demo and I was like, no.

[0:10:27 - 0:10:30]: And off of a literally said they were using selenium.

[0:10:30 - 0:10:31]: Yeah.

[0:10:31 - 0:10:32]: Okay.

[0:10:32 - 0:10:35]: And then I was like, I'm going to start with a lot of them was like cool.

[0:10:35 - 0:10:42]: So the original thing that I was asking it was like to do this. So it was like, okay, here.

[0:10:42 - 0:10:51]: And I learned from last time where I was like, because I realized a bunch of things that made it more difficult. So it's like here it's some complexities of formats.

[0:10:51 - 0:10:55]: So when one section loads, then you have to click next in the next section loads.

[0:10:55 - 0:11:03]: So it's not just text fields, there's drop downs, radio buttons, just an address selector. There's a file attachment.

[0:11:03 - 0:11:11]: And so I also like got better about specifying that and I added like the field type as well to that.

[0:11:11 - 0:11:16]: So it was like, okay, now we're going to try selenium.

[0:11:16 - 0:11:22]: So then I sort of said, here's what I want to do. I want to like, you know, here's what you want to do.

[0:11:22 - 0:11:26]: And then I want you to like input the stuff, the same complexities.

[0:11:26 - 0:11:31]: And then I also was like, here's how to navigate it.

[0:11:31 - 0:11:37]: Because I realized like, okay, it actually was complicated. You need to skip the search drop down.

[0:11:37 - 0:11:43]: Just to give you a reminder, you have to skip this section and this section go straight to here.

[0:11:43 - 0:11:48]: So it's not the very first thing on the page. I wanted to let it know, for example.

[0:11:48 - 0:11:58]: And then you fill this out also these fields are progressive. So you have to wait because what you select in level one needs to then load options in level two.

[0:11:58 - 0:12:06]: So then you select level two and that loads up and then you click next step with that button also only appears.

[0:12:06 - 0:12:12]: And then there's one level three is fills out. So you have to wait for that. You know, there was like a lot of that sort of thing.

[0:12:12 - 0:12:21]: And then also the dress as well was like the dress looks like this, which you can either click on a spot or you can enter a spot.

[0:12:21 - 0:12:26]: If you enter a spot, then you have to click this and then you have to click done.

[0:12:26 - 0:12:32]: So there's like all these like, when I actually went into it, I was like, oh, this is actually kind of calm.

[0:12:32 - 0:12:35]: And then I got like a form.

[0:12:35 - 0:12:46]: Like once I realize, oh, then you have to do that like, okay, so all of these sorts of things radio buttons and follow block.

[0:12:46 - 0:12:56]: So then I created a quad project.

[0:12:56 - 0:13:04]: Where I put in the background, which is basically this, I like basically this, the pdf.

[0:13:04 - 0:13:14]: And then I put in the page screenshots, which is basically this. And I added, you know, page one page two, you know, it was clear.

[0:13:14 - 0:13:27]: And then I added the form field instructions, which is basically this table.

[0:13:27 - 0:13:43]: And as I was chatting to it, I realized basically, you know, one of the things that said to me was like, hey, okay, like depending on what the actual selector name of the drop downs are, the code might need to change.

[0:13:43 - 0:13:52]: So you'll need to test it. And I was like, oh, right. Cause like, obviously the, the UI name of the field is not the selector type.

[0:13:52 - 0:13:58]: And then I went back to my property 24 scraping days. And I was like, I should probably show you what the code looks like.

[0:13:58 - 0:14:07]: So I went like, inspected elements. And then I like screenshot at those. And I put that into like, it's why.

[0:14:07 - 0:14:17]: Because also annoyingly, I don't know if you know work around for this. But when you do inspect element, you can't copy this in console.

[0:14:17 - 0:14:21]: Like you can't select it. Really? Yeah.

[0:14:21 - 0:14:30]: Like so, just, I mean, like as an example, I'm just going to go to my actual flashcards, but like what's I like inspect here.

[0:14:31 - 0:14:42]: Like you see, I'm like trying to copy it. I can't copy it. And then also if I do like control, like, see or like, you know, like I can't copy it.

[0:14:42 - 0:14:57]: And it looks different. This is like tells you how you knew I am. But I didn't realize that when you do view page source, it's actually different than when you, this is a bad example.

[0:14:57 - 0:15:04]: Because I actually very similar in this case, but they were totally different when I viewed page source versus inspected element.

[0:15:04 - 0:15:07]: The page source was super short.

[0:15:07 - 0:15:14]: And then the inspect element actually showed me all of the individual like, did everything.

[0:15:14 - 0:15:22]: So then I was like, all right, I don't know. I'm just going to like screenshot them. So this took a while for me to be like, OK, and the page two once that loaded.

[0:15:22 - 0:15:32]: And I did page two and the page three. OK, fine. So then I also at some point uploaded that. And I was like, OK, like based on this and then an actual club was like, OK, great.

[0:15:32 - 0:15:40]: Like I see. And it was interesting because it was like basically, it was like, this is much more complicated.

[0:15:40 - 0:15:49]: OK, because it was sorry, this is all the no JS stuff.

[0:15:49 - 0:15:54]: So yeah, so it was like, make the.

[0:15:54 - 0:15:58]: Like here, I was like, here's what it looks like.

[0:15:58 - 0:16:05]: And then it was like, oh, the drop down part of it, the part of class. And then it was like up updated uploading a full HTML.

[0:16:05 - 0:16:10]: And so then I gave it that pdf.

[0:16:10 - 0:16:16]: And then it was like, OK, there are consistent naming patterns.

[0:16:16 - 0:16:22]: But like here is like it shows you kind of like, this is the same page. I'm dynamically loaded content.

[0:16:22 - 0:16:27]: And multiple nested devs. And then.

[0:16:27 - 0:16:30]: Like.

[0:16:30 - 0:16:40]: And then they changed things. OK, but it was like, you know, fab u 15 complexities.

[0:16:40 - 0:16:44]: And I was like, oh god, that's all like this is going to be.

[0:16:44 - 0:16:47]: Yeah, like, you know.

[0:16:47 - 0:16:52]: I might have dynamic IDs or classes that change. I was like, oh god.

[0:16:52 - 0:16:56]: Because then that means that you can't collect it if they change between sessions.

[0:16:56 - 0:16:58]: And there are signs something based on the session.

[0:16:58 - 0:17:01]: Like, I don't know what's going to happen here.

[0:17:01 - 0:17:03]: So then I was like, OK, cool.

[0:17:03 - 0:17:05]: You can code with the fuck.

[0:17:05 - 0:17:12]: And so then it was like, OK, I need to install node JS.

[0:17:12 - 0:17:15]: I've heard of but also still don't really know what it does.

[0:17:15 - 0:17:18]: And then to ask me to do things in term, I was like, I don't want to do it in the terminal.

[0:17:18 - 0:17:20]: And I was like, you can use in pie.

[0:17:20 - 0:17:24]: I'm no person. I was like, I want to try cursor.

[0:17:24 - 0:17:27]: So then I created these two files.

[0:17:27 - 0:17:31]: I like, you know, ran the libraries that I needed or loaded the library.

[0:17:31 - 0:17:35]: I needed change the personal details in the file.

[0:17:35 - 0:17:39]: So it knows, you know, when it asks for first name, it always fills my first name with.

[0:17:39 - 0:17:40]: Yeah.

[0:17:40 - 0:17:43]: And then I ran it.

[0:17:43 - 0:17:53]: And basically it's like what I ran into effectively was it kept opening up the browser.

[0:17:53 - 0:17:56]: And then I would have immediately close it.

[0:17:56 - 0:18:01]: And I was like, oh, no, no, it started opening up the browser.

[0:18:01 - 0:18:04]: And then I was like, wait a second.

[0:18:04 - 0:18:07]: I actually don't want to submit anything.

[0:18:07 - 0:18:10]: I don't actually say, how do I do a dry run of it?

[0:18:10 - 0:18:15]: Like how do I see like, and there's a page basically, it takes you through to review.

[0:18:15 - 0:18:24]: Oh, it says time, OS is left in the meeting, by the way.

[0:18:24 - 0:18:28]: Maybe it's only for an hour.

[0:18:28 - 0:18:33]: Okay. So then.

[0:18:33 - 0:18:38]: So basically, it's like, how do I do a dry run?

[0:18:38 - 0:18:46]: Can I have it navigate all the way to the final review page and show me that it's filling out the thing like actually pull up the browser.

[0:18:46 - 0:18:51]: And so that was a whole thing to try to create a different dry run script.

[0:18:51 - 0:18:53]: And I saved that.

[0:18:53 - 0:18:54]: And then I tried to run that.

[0:18:54 - 0:18:59]: And so that's when it started opening the page and then basically kept closing.

[0:18:59 - 0:19:05]: And I kept running into these like wait for time out and blah, blah.

[0:19:05 - 0:19:08]: And it's like, it just wasn't actually running.

[0:19:08 - 0:19:14]: And actually did use cursor for this, but it wasn't a very good example of cursor because cursor also couldn't figure it out.

[0:19:14 - 0:19:24]: And I actually was like, I think this is exactly when you should into use cursor is what I realized is because there's too much extra context.

[0:19:24 - 0:19:31]: I needed to give it all the code base, all the navigation instructions, like everything I wanted to fill out.

[0:19:31 - 0:19:33]: Like there's too much extra.

[0:19:33 - 0:19:36]: The cursor is very good and I can show you.

[0:19:36 - 0:19:42]: Yeah, perfect for where you don't actually need all this external context to figure out a problem.

[0:19:42 - 0:19:43]: Okay.

[0:19:43 - 0:19:46]: And where the code kind of probably already works.

[0:19:46 - 0:19:50]: And you're trying to like make tweaks like this didn't work.

[0:19:51 - 0:19:54]: And so basically I couldn't figure it out.

[0:19:54 - 0:20:07]: And frankly, it would have been shit anyway because the way this worked was like I would have opened a cursor or pie charm and run and been like run this.

[0:20:07 - 0:20:18]: And then I would have been like, what do you want to do once street sweeper to do that three and like then I would have been like street sweeping and then really like where's the address.

[0:20:18 - 0:20:22]: Like it was going to be city anyway and I would only be able to adhere.

[0:20:22 - 0:20:26]: Maybe I could then try to create an interface for which book.

[0:20:26 - 0:20:34]: But it was going to be like a very long journey to getting something better than filling out the website manually.

[0:20:34 - 0:20:40]: And so I think at this point I'm probably going to give up on it also now having.

[0:20:40 - 0:20:44]: And I'm going to like actually write down all the steps.

[0:20:44 - 0:20:48]: Yeah, this is very complicated actually.

[0:20:48 - 0:20:56]: It's not just but I wonder but hypothetically, I would say you'd want to just be able to like give it in free text and have it fill it out.

[0:20:56 - 0:20:58]: So not like one by one need to tell the information.

[0:20:58 - 0:21:06]: Yes, which also like I could probably get to but still like the idea of then I have to open up cursor to run this thing.

[0:21:06 - 0:21:10]: Normally I'm like out and about on on my phone.

[0:21:10 - 0:21:14]: So then I would probably have to have something that.

[0:21:14 - 0:21:19]: But kind of like think like those are the one that I did write that I'm sending a WhatsApp.

[0:21:19 - 0:21:25]: And then it's on the back end it's already sending it to open API sending it to.

[0:21:25 - 0:21:30]: This is sort of like but this is what I mean it would be a long road to get to that point.

[0:21:30 - 0:21:34]: But anyway, just give us a WhatsApp message and then it would run everything.

[0:21:34 - 0:21:36]: And I can't even get it to run to the thing.

[0:21:36 - 0:21:38]: Yeah, no, if you could get it to run.

[0:21:38 - 0:21:44]: And I would say like yeah, then probably there's a way to not have to give it step by step.

[0:21:44 - 0:21:51]: Yes, but at least already now like.

[0:21:51 - 0:21:56]: I wouldn't ask me for everything but ask me for like the three or four things that I need to keep it.

[0:21:56 - 0:21:57]: But yeah.

[0:21:57 - 0:22:00]: Yeah, that was the least of my concerns was the input.

[0:22:00 - 0:22:04]: It was just that like it literally couldn't even.

[0:22:04 - 0:22:06]: Go.

[0:22:06 - 0:22:12]: And and I was like if we could even get like if we couldn't get past page one which honestly I thought was quite easy.

[0:22:12 - 0:22:13]: Right.

[0:22:13 - 0:22:17]: It's like skip two fields and three drop down fields.

[0:22:17 - 0:22:23]: Then that insane to me.

[0:22:23 - 0:22:27]: Like when we get to the like address piece.

[0:22:27 - 0:22:33]: Okay, so that was the fail.

[0:22:33 - 0:22:34]: Yeah.

[0:22:34 - 0:22:40]: And do you want to go do you want me to do the flash cars in another.

[0:22:40 - 0:22:41]: Okay.

[0:22:41 - 0:22:42]: So.

[0:22:42 - 0:22:45]: It looks cool.

[0:22:45 - 0:22:54]: Let me find.

[0:22:54 - 0:22:57]: Okay.

[0:22:57 - 0:23:00]: So.

[0:23:00 - 0:23:04]: Last time there were a couple things that I wanted.

[0:23:04 - 0:23:08]: Last time there were a couple things that I wanted to do.

[0:23:08 - 0:23:11]: And so actually this.

[0:23:11 - 0:23:15]: Like this technically I was in progress for that.

[0:23:15 - 0:23:21]: And so last time the I left by saying that I was trying to get the Indonesian voice for text to speech.

[0:23:21 - 0:23:24]: So I was like, I'm going to do it.

[0:23:24 - 0:23:31]: And the whole big finding there was that you could ask cloth to like piecemeal the code because the change was so long.

[0:23:31 - 0:23:34]: So as an example for why I think of course there's amazing.

[0:23:34 - 0:23:39]: And so basically I was able to be like, okay, cool.

[0:23:39 - 0:23:40]: Here.

[0:23:40 - 0:23:44]: I'm going to just like I was like.

[0:23:44 - 0:23:46]: So the agent.

[0:23:46 - 0:23:48]: So the flow.

[0:23:48 - 0:23:49]: Okay.

[0:23:49 - 0:23:50]: Or how I set this up.

[0:23:50 - 0:23:52]: Actually, maybe I should start there.

[0:23:52 - 0:23:53]: Yeah.

[0:23:53 - 0:23:57]: It is basically I have in.

[0:23:57 - 0:24:02]: Actually, I'm going to just share my whole screen for a second.

[0:24:02 - 0:24:05]: You connected your GitHub repo first.

[0:24:05 - 0:24:06]: Yes.

[0:24:06 - 0:24:12]: Although actually I technically didn't need to because all of the stuff is local.

[0:24:12 - 0:24:15]: So basically I have here a folder.

[0:24:15 - 0:24:19]: And that has all of my files.

[0:24:19 - 0:24:20]: Yeah.

[0:24:20 - 0:24:23]: I want to write update one of those I use GitHub desktop.

[0:24:23 - 0:24:26]: So then it changes it and get up desktop and I submit from there.

[0:24:26 - 0:24:28]: Do you do the same workflow?

[0:24:28 - 0:24:32]: No, because I'm like, I'm not updating my codes in the local file.

[0:24:32 - 0:24:39]: But like they are the local files, but I'm always opening them instead inside of Pitcharm or cursor.

[0:24:39 - 0:24:42]: And I'm doing the and I'm doing the deployments also from there.

[0:24:42 - 0:24:43]: Oh, okay.

[0:24:43 - 0:24:46]: I'm committing I'm committing from Pitcharm or from cursor.

[0:24:46 - 0:24:49]: Like I'm not committing through the GitHub desktop.

[0:24:49 - 0:24:52]: I probably could actually commit through cursor.

[0:24:52 - 0:24:54]: I can show you because it's the wave.

[0:24:54 - 0:24:55]: Okay.

[0:24:55 - 0:24:59]: It sees all the changes you just comment on what happened to commit.

[0:24:59 - 0:25:01]: Oh, that's what you do here too.

[0:25:01 - 0:25:02]: So.

[0:25:02 - 0:25:03]: But basically,

[0:25:03 - 0:25:04]: I'm like, you're doing it as you.

[0:25:04 - 0:25:05]: Yeah.

[0:25:05 - 0:25:06]: Okay.

[0:25:06 - 0:25:09]: I think there's a save version you can just.

[0:25:09 - 0:25:11]: Comment.

[0:25:11 - 0:25:12]: Yeah.

[0:25:12 - 0:25:13]: Right next to the code.

[0:25:13 - 0:25:14]: Yeah.

[0:25:14 - 0:25:15]: It's not the same thing.

[0:25:15 - 0:25:17]: If you said the buttons are.

[0:25:17 - 0:25:18]: Yeah.

[0:25:18 - 0:25:19]: Basically here though.

[0:25:19 - 0:25:21]: So this is just loaded from my local.

[0:25:21 - 0:25:23]: And so now I'm like, okay.

[0:25:23 - 0:25:26]: So I've connected it to that folder.

[0:25:26 - 0:25:27]: Basically.

[0:25:27 - 0:25:31]: And that folder is connected to GitHub.

[0:25:31 - 0:25:33]: And so I say like so level.

[0:25:33 - 0:25:36]: What into you logic in them that force a text of voice to be.

[0:25:36 - 0:25:37]: Where did you write?

[0:25:37 - 0:25:40]: So like here you you clicked on the agent.

[0:25:40 - 0:25:41]: Yeah.

[0:25:41 - 0:25:43]: So basically the chat part.

[0:25:43 - 0:25:44]: Yeah.

[0:25:44 - 0:25:45]: So this is what I do.

[0:25:45 - 0:25:47]: I open project.

[0:25:47 - 0:25:48]: And then I'm like,

[0:25:48 - 0:25:51]: I want to open up my Indonesian flashcards project.

[0:25:51 - 0:25:53]: And that opens up.

[0:25:53 - 0:25:54]: And so all of this is here.

[0:25:54 - 0:25:56]: And you see that there's this code here.

[0:25:56 - 0:25:58]: And then I can type here.

[0:25:58 - 0:26:01]: But when you're typing, are you adding like a give it?

[0:26:01 - 0:26:02]: Okay.

[0:26:02 - 0:26:03]: So I can type.

[0:26:03 - 0:26:04]: So I can type.

[0:26:04 - 0:26:05]: I did sometimes add content.

[0:26:05 - 0:26:06]: So you added like fun.

[0:26:06 - 0:26:08]: But like here.

[0:26:08 - 0:26:13]: I keep on getting like that I need cursor pro.

[0:26:13 - 0:26:14]: Oh yeah.

[0:26:14 - 0:26:17]: Because it says agent and edit rely on.

[0:26:17 - 0:26:20]: Custom models that cannot be built in API key.

[0:26:20 - 0:26:25]: Please use a pro business absorption and are disabled API keys.

[0:26:25 - 0:26:27]: I don't know.

[0:26:27 - 0:26:30]: Maybe I need to disable API keys.

[0:26:30 - 0:26:31]: I don't know.

[0:26:31 - 0:26:34]: I did almost no setup as far as I remember.

[0:26:34 - 0:26:35]: Weird.

[0:26:35 - 0:26:36]: Okay.

[0:26:36 - 0:26:39]: So I'll try to ask the stupidity how do I?

[0:26:39 - 0:26:43]: So yeah, basically like then I just ask questions here.

[0:26:43 - 0:26:47]: And so here for instance, I was like,

[0:26:47 - 0:26:52]: OK, so previously clawed had helped me remember rewrite the level one and two.

[0:26:52 - 0:26:53]: But this was the whole thing.

[0:26:53 - 0:26:54]: Yes.

[0:26:54 - 0:26:55]: It was too long.

[0:26:55 - 0:26:59]: So it was like, I was previously I was having this problem where my iPhone is a far

[0:26:59 - 0:27:01]: browser read those words with an English accent.

[0:27:01 - 0:27:03]: So then I caught six levels one two.

[0:27:03 - 0:27:05]: Never got around to fixing levels three and four.

[0:27:05 - 0:27:11]: Could you help the girl which piece of code was inserted into levels one and two regarding this Indonesian voice sound.

[0:27:11 - 0:27:14]: And then insert it into levels three and four.

[0:27:14 - 0:27:17]: So then it can see everything that was changed.

[0:27:17 - 0:27:19]: And then check the content.

[0:27:19 - 0:27:21]: And then check level four.

[0:27:21 - 0:27:23]: And then be like, OK, cool.

[0:27:23 - 0:27:25]: Well, these are things.

[0:27:25 - 0:27:27]: And then it edits them.

[0:27:27 - 0:27:32]: And what's cool about it is that whenever it makes any sort of change,

[0:27:32 - 0:27:34]: this is sort of what it looks like.

[0:27:34 - 0:27:38]: So it'll show me what's changed here.

[0:27:38 - 0:27:41]: And then I can also go through here.

[0:27:41 - 0:27:49]: And it's like a track changes in word in like a word doc like I can be I can individually be like accept this reject this.

[0:27:49 - 0:27:54]: Or I can be like in word like accept all changes.

[0:27:54 - 0:27:57]: And it can do it across all of my files.

[0:27:57 - 0:27:59]: And now this is like live right.

[0:27:59 - 0:28:01]: So now it's updated.

[0:28:01 - 0:28:02]: Three and four.

[0:28:02 - 0:28:04]: And now I just commit.

[0:28:04 - 0:28:08]: Or I can open up locally to see if it looks good.

[0:28:08 - 0:28:11]: And and then even.

[0:28:11 - 0:28:17]: And which models are you using it so that if you go to hit settings and your cursor.

[0:28:17 - 0:28:19]: And I think it will tell me here.

[0:28:19 - 0:28:20]: I know.

[0:28:20 - 0:28:23]: And now I hit the setting button at their top right.

[0:28:23 - 0:28:27]: It just says auto select based on availability.

[0:28:27 - 0:28:29]: I just see they hit the settings of the top right.

[0:28:29 - 0:28:31]: I just want to see that I have the same thing like sitting.

[0:28:31 - 0:28:34]: Notice chop right up the cursor.

[0:28:34 - 0:28:36]: The settings like we have.

[0:28:36 - 0:28:37]: Yeah.

[0:28:37 - 0:28:39]: And then go down.

[0:28:39 - 0:28:42]: The porting models.

[0:28:42 - 0:28:45]: Face call down.

[0:28:45 - 0:28:50]: And then you can see you don't have a key set up either.

[0:28:50 - 0:28:55]: Oh wait, the joy one is to scroll all the way down.

[0:28:55 - 0:28:56]: Yeah, also open.

[0:28:56 - 0:28:57]: Yeah, I've nothing.

[0:28:57 - 0:28:58]: I did what I mean.

[0:28:58 - 0:29:01]: I set up nothing.

[0:29:01 - 0:29:05]: Yeah, so it's just like weird that for me it's not working.

[0:29:05 - 0:29:06]: Do you have a key save?

[0:29:06 - 0:29:07]: Maybe just.

[0:29:07 - 0:29:08]: Oh.

[0:29:08 - 0:29:12]: Okay.

[0:29:12 - 0:29:15]: So I mean, this is like.

[0:29:15 - 0:29:20]: And so basically also is like, oh, I want to be able to.

[0:29:20 - 0:29:26]: And so I like I even was like, for instance, remember I had those test HTML's

[0:29:26 - 0:29:29]: because I didn't want to like change things.

[0:29:29 - 0:29:32]: So it was like, can you copy.

[0:29:32 - 0:29:35]: Like everything in level one and put it into.

[0:29:35 - 0:29:36]: And delete.

[0:29:36 - 0:29:39]: Can you delete everything in a test copy everything from level one.

[0:29:39 - 0:29:42]: Put it into like test and so it did that.

[0:29:42 - 0:29:44]: And then I was like, cool.

[0:29:44 - 0:29:47]: Now this is a version of like level one that we can play around with.

[0:29:47 - 0:29:48]: Can you.

[0:29:48 - 0:29:49]: I want to try to do this.

[0:29:49 - 0:29:50]: Can you edit it?

[0:29:50 - 0:29:51]: It edited it.

[0:29:51 - 0:29:52]: I tested it.

[0:29:52 - 0:29:54]: And I was like, oh, that works.

[0:29:54 - 0:29:56]: Can you now reinsert this into level one?

[0:29:56 - 0:29:57]: It did that.

[0:29:57 - 0:29:59]: And I was like, actually I wanted to be in all levels.

[0:29:59 - 0:30:03]: Can you do it for level two, three and four and also did all that?

[0:30:03 - 0:30:05]: I mean, so otherwise and clawed.

[0:30:05 - 0:30:07]: First of all, it's too long.

[0:30:07 - 0:30:10]: So I had to do the insane thing of like each time.

[0:30:10 - 0:30:11]: Yeah.

[0:30:11 - 0:30:12]: It took a lot longer.

[0:30:12 - 0:30:14]: And then clawed but run out.

[0:30:14 - 0:30:15]: Yeah.

[0:30:15 - 0:30:16]: Yeah.

[0:30:16 - 0:30:20]: And then I had to actually copy and paste into each one again.

[0:30:20 - 0:30:23]: Now it's already like editing it live for me.

[0:30:23 - 0:30:25]: And mistakes.

[0:30:25 - 0:30:27]: I was like, ooh, that didn't work.

[0:30:27 - 0:30:30]: Revert and it like reverted perfectly.

[0:30:30 - 0:30:34]: And then that was quite nice.

[0:30:34 - 0:30:38]: And so I did that for all of these, you know, and by the way,

[0:30:38 - 0:30:41]: are you sending to ask or agent?

[0:30:41 - 0:30:44]: To agent.

[0:30:44 - 0:30:46]: Which also is the default.

[0:30:46 - 0:30:48]: I changed.

[0:30:48 - 0:30:52]: And.

[0:30:52 - 0:30:55]: And then also, you know, like then I, then I was like, okay,

[0:30:55 - 0:30:58]: let's see if you can like fully create new things.

[0:30:58 - 0:31:00]: And I was like.

[0:31:00 - 0:31:02]: Add level five.

[0:31:02 - 0:31:05]: And this is what I want it to be.

[0:31:05 - 0:31:08]: And I was like, okay, I just wanted to be kind of similar to level two.

[0:31:08 - 0:31:10]: But I don't want to be able to see the word.

[0:31:10 - 0:31:15]: I just want to hear the Indonesian sound and see if I can figure out what it means in English.

[0:31:15 - 0:31:18]: And like use the play button that I used elsewhere.

[0:31:18 - 0:31:21]: And it knew to not just create level two, but it was like,

[0:31:21 - 0:31:23]: oh, you also need to update the index file.

[0:31:23 - 0:31:25]: So there's a button to get to it.

[0:31:25 - 0:31:26]: Cool.

[0:31:26 - 0:31:31]: So that it was supposed to be like clawed whatever integrated into your code.

[0:31:31 - 0:31:34]: Yeah, for me, it's still even now.

[0:31:34 - 0:31:37]: I'll have to I just ask because it's still like saying I can't.

[0:31:37 - 0:31:39]: Oh, okay.

[0:31:39 - 0:31:42]: That's what you see like what's so much bit like it's just so.

[0:31:42 - 0:31:44]: Yeah, of course, yeah, yeah.

[0:31:44 - 0:31:48]: It makes sense because like you don't have to do all the back of the face being in back.

[0:31:48 - 0:31:50]: Yeah, because it just sees the whole project.

[0:31:50 - 0:31:52]: And you don't have to upload the project like I'm doing out of a sinking now.

[0:31:52 - 0:31:55]: Also the project like every team like I'm right with it because it sees everything.

[0:31:55 - 0:31:58]: And it's a little bit like, you know, one thing that is better about chat.

[0:31:58 - 0:32:02]: The thing is that can this thing where you can edit it and it can see.

[0:32:02 - 0:32:03]: So now I can edit it.

[0:32:03 - 0:32:08]: Oh, the other thing is when they were running into errors because I'm running in terminal there.

[0:32:08 - 0:32:12]: I'd be like there like check the error fix it.

[0:32:12 - 0:32:18]: You know, to copy and paste the error and like, then I just like fixes it.

[0:32:18 - 0:32:22]: And it.

[0:32:22 - 0:32:27]: I think maybe because I haven't tried the repo thing in clawed because remember we had the issue.

[0:32:27 - 0:32:30]: If it was connected to anyone.

[0:32:30 - 0:32:33]: But I was able to know I connected it to you.

[0:32:33 - 0:32:34]: Yeah.

[0:32:34 - 0:32:37]: But then it also was a lot better because it could see the whole repo.

[0:32:37 - 0:32:39]: So maybe clawed would be better that way also.

[0:32:39 - 0:32:42]: But I just felt like the code it was writing.

[0:32:42 - 0:32:48]: What the lot better like even for instance, it noticed when creating this.

[0:32:48 - 0:32:56]: All of these icons that I had created for way with art breeder were always named level four dot jpeg level three dot.

[0:32:56 - 0:32:59]: Jpeg in a specific place.

[0:32:59 - 0:33:03]: So it just assumed I was going to create an image called level five dot jpeg and insert it that in.

[0:33:03 - 0:33:07]: So this was actually blank earlier and then I was like, oh, fuck, I need an image.

[0:33:07 - 0:33:10]: And once I love labeled it level five jpeg it showed up.

[0:33:10 - 0:33:14]: So it was even able to be like, oh, okay, I see what you're doing here.

[0:33:14 - 0:33:19]: I'm going to continue this same syntax.

[0:33:19 - 0:33:22]: I don't know if I'm just done a different.

[0:33:22 - 0:33:23]: I'll show you now.

[0:33:23 - 0:33:24]: Let me just take this.

[0:33:24 - 0:33:31]: If I'm just done a different beta bird like a testing version for cloud not for a cursor.

[0:33:31 - 0:33:36]: Because this is screen once again because they're given here.

[0:33:36 - 0:33:40]: Like see here it says like high load we're experiencing a high demand.

[0:33:40 - 0:33:44]: So please upgrade to pro or switch the default mode.

[0:33:44 - 0:33:46]: How do I switch the different?

[0:33:46 - 0:33:48]: So.

[0:33:48 - 0:33:53]: Go to agents on the bottom.

[0:33:53 - 0:33:57]: Yeah, I am in default.

[0:33:57 - 0:33:59]: So like here is I put it.

[0:33:59 - 0:34:08]: So it just or maybe I don't know maybe it's my country and it's just a work time in Israel now and everyone's using cursor.

[0:34:08 - 0:34:11]: Yeah.

[0:34:11 - 0:34:12]: That's out.

[0:34:12 - 0:34:16]: Yeah, that's super irritating because it's so much better.

[0:34:16 - 0:34:22]: Yeah, but if it's so yeah, but then maybe it's like instead of paying for cloud right.

[0:34:22 - 0:34:25]: Yeah, it's like instead of paying for.

[0:34:25 - 0:34:30]: Yeah, I accept that I guess like plot like you can't have it right thing.

[0:34:30 - 0:34:36]: But the one thing now, whatever you need both, but it's kind of.

[0:34:36 - 0:34:43]: Yeah, the one annoying thing that I think they'll probably fix is like you see how you can add context.

[0:34:43 - 0:34:48]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can like tag a file.

[0:34:48 - 0:34:58]: First of all, you don't really need to because it has access to every I first I was doing that a lot and then I was like actually this is like stupid like I can just be like look at level one.

[0:34:58 - 0:35:00]: You have access to the whole thing.

[0:35:00 - 0:35:03]: I think maybe it only makes sense if you're do.

[0:35:03 - 0:35:09]: But like, I don't yeah, hold on. Let me just show you what I mean.

[0:35:09 - 0:35:21]: Because basically, I guess you can add like other files or whatever, but as far as I know like when I added something like I'll say added that.

[0:35:21 - 0:35:26]: Okay, you see I don't think I can add multiple things.

[0:35:26 - 0:35:29]: Oh, you can. I didn't try.

[0:35:29 - 0:35:36]: Okay, so actually maybe it would have been fine when I was trying the other project I could have added multiple things.

[0:35:36 - 0:35:39]: Because you see it looks like.

[0:35:39 - 0:35:45]: Do you know what I mean? It doesn't say that or context. I did it. I thought that I could only add one.

[0:35:45 - 0:35:47]: Okay.

[0:35:47 - 0:35:53]: Yeah, I thought I guess if you can start to like from scratch.

[0:35:53 - 0:35:55]: Yeah, so I am actually.

[0:35:55 - 0:36:11]: So people have so the reason I actually went back to cursor is red of blog post of someone who said that he used cursor and super whisper, which super whisper is basically dictation but much better than anything else.

[0:36:11 - 0:36:14]: Apparently that's out there.

[0:36:14 - 0:36:21]: And so he connected the two so that instead of typing here, he would just speak to cursor.

[0:36:22 - 0:36:30]: And he had a goal to basically never touch his keyboard and say if you could build something from scratch.

[0:36:30 - 0:36:38]: It's so fun. And he built this little game and it looked amazing.

[0:36:38 - 0:36:41]: I mean, there was like not much to it. He just like it.

[0:36:41 - 0:36:46]: So he was just doing over lands, but you know, it had to create a whole universe and you had to like avoid stuff.

[0:36:46 - 0:36:51]: And if you went into something you would crash that was the whole game.

[0:36:51 - 0:36:58]: But I mean, it's still amazing that you could basically not use your keyboard and speak to cursor and have it develop at all from scratch.

[0:36:58 - 0:37:02]: And so people do.

[0:37:02 - 0:37:07]: And you can also like have it explain code to you. So I think developers are also doing that.

[0:37:07 - 0:37:12]: So you would have to use a mouse mouse and create a piece and be like what is this doing?

[0:37:12 - 0:37:22]: And actually a couple different times. I was like after it changed something, I was like, I just want to check that the logic is still in place to use the waiting of the words.

[0:37:22 - 0:37:29]: And or whatever and it was like yes, and then it actually was really good at explaining like yes.

[0:37:29 - 0:37:31]: here in this piece of code, this does this,

[0:37:31 - 0:37:32]: in this piece of code, this does this.

[0:37:32 - 0:37:37]: It was much better than Quad or GPT

[0:37:37 - 0:37:40]: at being able to pull it out in a format that works really well.

[0:37:40 - 0:37:41]: And then when you click on it,

[0:37:41 - 0:37:43]: it auto scrolls to where the code is.

[0:37:43 - 0:37:48]: Like, so that, oh, I guess I should,

[0:37:51 - 0:37:54]: yeah, so now basically, I mean,

[0:37:55 - 0:37:58]: so this is level five.

[0:37:58 - 0:37:59]: Can you hear it?

[0:38:01 - 0:38:04]: No, no, wait, hold on me.

[0:38:04 - 0:38:05]: Thanks.

[0:38:07 - 0:38:10]: Also shared tab output.

[0:38:12 - 0:38:13]: Okay.

[0:38:13 - 0:38:14]: Do you hear that?

[0:38:14 - 0:38:16]: Very softly.

[0:38:16 - 0:38:18]: I don't think I need it to be louder.

[0:38:18 - 0:38:19]: Money.

[0:38:19 - 0:38:20]: Sorry about.

[0:38:20 - 0:38:21]: Yeah.

[0:38:21 - 0:38:27]: And so minutes, okay.

[0:38:28 - 0:38:31]: And then, so that was a change.

[0:38:31 - 0:38:32]: I can now reset the deck.

[0:38:32 - 0:38:36]: So now it's seen a few times.

[0:38:36 - 0:38:37]: I've clicked this a few times.

[0:38:37 - 0:38:40]: But now I'm like, actually, I want to ignore all of my stats

[0:38:40 - 0:38:41]: and reset it.

[0:38:41 - 0:38:44]: Now I can, oh, no, just that work.

[0:38:44 - 0:38:46]: Oh, maybe I need to now.

[0:38:47 - 0:38:49]: Mingu or Harimingu?

[0:38:50 - 0:38:52]: That's Sunday.

[0:38:53 - 0:38:54]: Sunday.

[0:38:55 - 0:38:57]: And you see it's like, oh,

[0:38:57 - 0:39:00]: maybe the reset doesn't work.

[0:39:00 - 0:39:00]: Okay.

[0:39:00 - 0:39:04]: But so that and that now I can multi select categories

[0:39:04 - 0:39:06]: because before it has a select one category,

[0:39:06 - 0:39:08]: but I was like, actually now I've studied a few things.

[0:39:08 - 0:39:09]: I want to.

[0:39:09 - 0:39:12]: And so that changed and that level one.

[0:39:16 - 0:39:18]: It has parking along.

[0:39:18 - 0:39:19]: Bagima.

[0:39:21 - 0:39:22]: And.

[0:39:26 - 0:39:27]: Now, okay.

[0:39:28 - 0:39:31]: So when there's a personal note that I've included,

[0:39:31 - 0:39:33]: like you to remember something.

[0:39:33 - 0:39:34]: Yeah.

[0:39:34 - 0:39:37]: That like it, which is a column I've just added now,

[0:39:37 - 0:39:38]: it'll show me that.

[0:39:38 - 0:39:39]: And so that is cool.

[0:39:39 - 0:39:41]: So that was the other change.

[0:39:41 - 0:39:44]: And then also level six, which I really want.

[0:39:44 - 0:39:45]: It sound only said.

[0:39:48 - 0:39:51]: And then if I like that will tell me that the main thing

[0:39:51 - 0:39:56]: is a pronoun and that this will show me what it actually says.

[0:39:57 - 0:40:00]: So that was another change, but these were like two new levels.

[0:40:00 - 0:40:03]: And obviously also art pre-der to get those.

[0:40:03 - 0:40:07]: And then the UI for this change so that I could do more levels.

[0:40:08 - 0:40:13]: And then study mode now, one of the issues was like,

[0:40:13 - 0:40:14]: it was randomizing.

[0:40:14 - 0:40:15]: I was like, oh, actually doesn't make sense.

[0:40:15 - 0:40:18]: Like for instance, for numbers, I want it to be.

[0:40:18 - 0:40:21]: And then it was the pattern before.

[0:40:21 - 0:40:24]: And I was like, actually, I feel like I am not reading like this

[0:40:24 - 0:40:25]: for numbers.

[0:40:25 - 0:40:28]: Like I wanted to read like an end pattern.

[0:40:28 - 0:40:29]: So I told her to do that.

[0:40:32 - 0:40:36]: And then I'm not sure if all was so changed.

[0:40:36 - 0:40:40]: I think that was basically, oh, and then obviously the text

[0:40:40 - 0:40:41]: the speech for all the other levels.

[0:40:41 - 0:40:44]: So those were all the changes that I made there.

[0:40:44 - 0:40:48]: But all using cursor did not touch, pod or GPD for this.

[0:40:49 - 0:40:50]: Which is quite cool.

[0:40:50 - 0:40:51]: Cool.

[0:40:52 - 0:40:53]: Yeah, that's really cool.

[0:40:55 - 0:41:02]: And also kind of interesting, because it's like then you didn't pay.

[0:41:03 - 0:41:04]: Yeah.

[0:41:05 - 0:41:11]: And actually, I mean, that was quite a lot of code that it wrote.

[0:41:11 - 0:41:12]: Yeah.

[0:41:12 - 0:41:14]: Cannot have had me pay for anything.

[0:41:14 - 0:41:19]: And I think like I also used it for, I mean, the fail, right?

[0:41:19 - 0:41:21]: So like, it's nervous thing.

[0:41:21 - 0:41:26]: So it's like I spent probably four hours with it yesterday

[0:41:27 - 0:41:29]: to not have asked me to pay is quite crazy.

[0:41:29 - 0:41:30]: Yeah.

[0:41:30 - 0:41:33]: And you're signed in, right?

[0:41:33 - 0:41:34]: To your cursor.

[0:41:34 - 0:41:38]: Yeah, I think I'm probably just I think I generally signed in.

[0:41:38 - 0:41:39]: Everything is hello up.

[0:41:39 - 0:41:40]: Maybe I signed in this Charlie.

[0:41:40 - 0:41:43]: Yeah, I'm just trying to figure out why mine's not.

[0:41:43 - 0:41:44]: It's not.

[0:41:45 - 0:41:48]: No, I know, but also in case if you want to just sign in.

[0:41:49 - 0:41:53]: If I am signed in this hello at that potentially,

[0:41:53 - 0:41:55]: so maybe then it will like freak out.

[0:41:55 - 0:41:59]: But I find.

[0:42:05 - 0:42:08]: And the few things the settings wheel it says like where you're sending us.

[0:42:12 - 0:42:16]: Where the settings wheel at the top right, the button.

[0:42:17 - 0:42:21]: Yeah, I have it says like it says like you were currently sending.

[0:42:21 - 0:42:24]: Oh, I'm signing it's Charlie at.

[0:42:24 - 0:42:25]: Okay.

[0:42:25 - 0:42:29]: Okay, so I'll try to troubleshoot and see why.

[0:42:29 - 0:42:33]: I mean, it's been very, very, very smart of it.

[0:42:33 - 0:42:34]: But what are you signing us?

[0:42:34 - 0:42:38]: No, and Lebron, just no, just that I can't chat.

[0:42:38 - 0:42:39]: I'll try it again.

[0:42:40 - 0:42:43]: It'll be very smart of it to.

[0:42:44 - 0:42:48]: Of the growth team to do this, but to basically.

[0:42:48 - 0:42:51]: Give preference to people with non personal emails.

[0:42:52 - 0:42:57]: Which is actually very easy to do, but would be like a decision that someone would have had to think about.

[0:42:57 - 0:43:04]: Yeah, I mean, but like you can just be like any Gmail any hot mail any Yahoo dot com.

[0:43:04 - 0:43:08]: It's like yeah, yeah, exactly if we're going to queue.

[0:43:09 - 0:43:13]: Queue people with company emails that are more likely to like pay for it.

[0:43:14 - 0:43:16]: I don't think it's a bad strategy.

[0:43:16 - 0:43:19]: I just would be impressed with someone actually thought through that.

[0:43:19 - 0:43:24]: Oh, by the way, just seeing how like I got the time OS.

[0:43:24 - 0:43:29]: Notes and it was working even when we said don't watch.

[0:43:29 - 0:43:34]: Because I guess it just doesn't watch this screen, but it's still listening.

[0:43:34 - 0:43:41]: It's confusing because you say mute, which still means you can like in human terms, it wouldn't mean you can't speak.

[0:43:41 - 0:43:43]: You can just hear still.

[0:43:46 - 0:43:49]: Yeah, but still like it's misleading.

[0:43:49 - 0:43:51]: Yeah, that is misleading.

[0:43:51 - 0:43:57]: Because like I just I feel like every time we even would do a circle back or whatever like we assumed it wasn't.

[0:43:57 - 0:44:00]: Did we check circle backs?

[0:44:01 - 0:44:05]: I'm sure I just wasn't watching.

[0:44:05 - 0:44:14]: Yeah, which is like on the one hand at least it's transparent that it's recording, which granola is not.

[0:44:14 - 0:44:18]: But on the other hand, at least I can actually tell granola to stop.

[0:44:18 - 0:44:22]: Yeah, and I can see that it's no longer like it's not in the transcript.

[0:44:22 - 0:44:24]: It's like, yeah, actually stopped.

[0:44:24 - 0:44:26]: Yeah.

[0:44:27 - 0:44:31]: Yeah, it's funny. So I guess it also stops like after an hour or something like that.

[0:44:31 - 0:44:37]: I guess just because I got the summary email now.

[0:44:37 - 0:44:39]: Yeah.

[0:44:39 - 0:44:43]: But that's super cool. Okay. I need to try to get my cursor to work.

[0:44:43 - 0:44:47]: Yeah, I think it's super cool.

[0:44:47 - 0:44:54]: Okay. So what I'll show you is like part of it was just like in.

[0:44:54 - 0:44:59]: extension of what it did last time.

[0:44:59 - 0:45:04]: So last time if you remember, I was trying to.

[0:45:04 - 0:45:08]: I wanted to be able to text my WhatsApp.

[0:45:08 - 0:45:14]: And be able to either use a voice message or text it and say like I ran five miles and have a log it.

[0:45:14 - 0:45:19]: And so I was trying to do like the Google sheets that didn't that didn't work, which is like human good Google sheets.

[0:45:19 - 0:45:24]: And then I moved to air table and that I got to work.

[0:45:24 - 0:45:28]: And so that basically and you can see here in cursor.

[0:45:28 - 0:45:31]: I have a product health tracker MVP.

[0:45:31 - 0:45:33]: And I have.

[0:45:33 - 0:45:34]: You're not.

[0:45:34 - 0:45:36]: Yeah.

[0:45:36 - 0:45:44]: Okay.

[0:45:44 - 0:45:49]: So I have a health tracker MVP and I have no an air table service.

[0:45:49 - 0:45:57]: Hmm.

[0:45:57 - 0:45:58]: I want to.

[0:45:58 - 0:46:04]: So I just want to make it so it's bigger on the screen.

[0:46:04 - 0:46:06]: Okay.

[0:46:06 - 0:46:11]: So there's a service here for air table.

[0:46:11 - 0:46:15]: And you can see here by the way.

[0:46:15 - 0:46:21]: So one of the things I have my dot and ENV file that has all my keys.

[0:46:21 - 0:46:24]: And then I have this dot ENV example.

[0:46:24 - 0:46:27]: And in the.

[0:46:27 - 0:46:33]: In my setup kind of thing or read me.

[0:46:33 - 0:46:34]: Yeah.

[0:46:34 - 0:46:40]: So it's going to tell someone who's looking at the project like copy their dot ENV dot example to that to and create it.

[0:46:40 - 0:46:46]: And then there's a lot of things that I want to do.

[0:46:46 - 0:46:50]: And so I have a deserved to have an active V.

[0:46:50 - 0:46:51]: And then edit attack.

[0:46:51 - 0:46:54]: And then in my get ignore.

[0:46:54 - 0:46:56]: It says to not.

[0:46:56 - 0:46:58]: So when I'm committing essentially no one is getting any of these keys.

[0:46:58 - 0:47:02]: And then all my code right doesn't actually list any of the.

[0:47:02 - 0:47:03]: Okay.

[0:47:03 - 0:47:08]: understand how that works because how does it work?

[0:47:08 - 0:47:11]: It's called the .env file.

[0:47:11 - 0:47:14]: That's all on your local.

[0:47:14 - 0:47:16]: Yeah, but anyone who's using it,

[0:47:16 - 0:47:22]: right, they're going to download and they're going to take this.env.example.

[0:47:22 - 0:47:29]: They're going to update it to a .env and then they're going to add there.

[0:47:29 - 0:47:31]: But the .env is nowhere in GitHub.

[0:47:31 - 0:47:34]: Yeah, exactly because it doesn't get uploaded to GitHub.

[0:47:34 - 0:47:38]: It's because it's my code will always require the .env

[0:47:38 - 0:47:40]: to exist on your local.

[0:47:40 - 0:47:42]: Yeah.

[0:47:42 - 0:47:43]: Or wherever you're running it.

[0:47:43 - 0:47:45]: Yeah.

[0:47:45 - 0:47:49]: Oh, I see because I guess in a larger scale,

[0:47:49 - 0:47:51]: instead of sitting on someone's computer,

[0:47:51 - 0:47:54]: it could sit in a separate like secret server that gets like.

[0:47:54 - 0:47:56]: I think I'm running this.

[0:47:56 - 0:47:57]: Sorry, sorry, I didn't talk to you.

[0:47:57 - 0:47:58]: I'm running this in Heroku.

[0:47:58 - 0:48:00]: So that gets running in Heroku.

[0:48:00 - 0:48:03]: It's just like it's in my personal.

[0:48:03 - 0:48:06]: Yeah, but I guess if you were like a company,

[0:48:06 - 0:48:08]: it's not sitting on someone's random computers.

[0:48:08 - 0:48:09]: I'm like moving through it.

[0:48:09 - 0:48:13]: Like I guess it would just sit in some sort of like equivalent of like a last pass or something.

[0:48:13 - 0:48:17]: You know, like I see.

[0:48:17 - 0:48:19]: And it's just like pulling it from there.

[0:48:19 - 0:48:22]: Because like where like the keys need to exist somewhere.

[0:48:22 - 0:48:29]: That's how it's like it's interesting that they didn't tell you to put it in GitHub secrets.

[0:48:29 - 0:48:33]: Well, because they're assuming like I think the thing with GitHub is that you're going to try to run this

[0:48:33 - 0:48:34]: project to right.

[0:48:34 - 0:48:37]: So then you're going to create your own file here.

[0:48:37 - 0:48:41]: You're going to create your own dot in with your tokens.

[0:48:41 - 0:48:43]: And then you run it wherever your server is.

[0:48:43 - 0:48:45]: So I'm using Heroku.

[0:48:45 - 0:48:46]: Yeah.

[0:48:46 - 0:48:55]: But if you like changed computers, it wouldn't work because you need to create a new ENV file that you put on your computer.

[0:48:55 - 0:48:58]: Well, whether I could I could copy.

[0:48:58 - 0:49:00]: Yeah, I mean, I would need to copy it again.

[0:49:00 - 0:49:03]: None of the tokens will change if I change it from here.

[0:49:03 - 0:49:03]: Right.

[0:49:03 - 0:49:04]: Yeah.

[0:49:04 - 0:49:06]: I need to copy the information.

[0:49:07 - 0:49:12]: And also, by the way, when I publish to when I deploy to Heroku.

[0:49:12 - 0:49:12]: Oh, yeah.

[0:49:12 - 0:49:13]: Tell me how that.

[0:49:13 - 0:49:18]: So when I deploy to Heroku, so you create an account and you create a new file.

[0:49:19 - 0:49:23]: Oh, this one that just says in my case, Web node app.

[0:49:23 - 0:49:23]: GS.

[0:49:26 - 0:49:28]: But every time.

[0:49:29 - 0:49:30]: Sorry, not every day.

[0:49:30 - 0:49:37]: And then I, and then I like connected to the GitHub repository and I log in and I create a new app.

[0:49:37 - 0:49:37]: So I have an app.

[0:49:37 - 0:49:42]: But I want like the first time I have to set.

[0:49:42 - 0:49:44]: Do you see I sent her Heroku the tokens.

[0:49:45 - 0:49:50]: So Heroku has saved my tokens.

[0:49:50 - 0:49:52]: Okay.

[0:49:52 - 0:49:52]: Okay.

[0:49:52 - 0:49:56]: So that's where it probably lives actually.

[0:49:56 - 0:49:58]: Yeah.

[0:49:58 - 0:50:02]: And then I push like and then I, you know, push any updates and I open and then.

[0:50:03 - 0:50:05]: And then so I have a Heroku.

[0:50:05 - 0:50:06]: I'll show it in a second.

[0:50:06 - 0:50:10]: And then I also needed to take this app and put it in Twilio.

[0:50:13 - 0:50:15]: There's a specific one in the sandbox.

[0:50:16 - 0:50:18]: So for example, I was able to run it and then.

[0:50:20 - 0:50:23]: Let's see because the test in books really was like 72 hours.

[0:50:23 - 0:50:24]: So it is possible that.

[0:50:26 - 0:50:28]: But here, this is my Heroku app.

[0:50:28 - 0:50:32]: And so basically if I refresh it, I get my health checker API is running.

[0:50:32 - 0:50:38]: So when this is working, I basically can text.

[0:50:40 - 0:50:40]: I can.

[0:50:43 - 0:50:44]: Can I what?

[0:50:44 - 0:50:46]: You can use iPhone mirror by the way.

[0:50:46 - 0:50:48]: If it's if you don't have what's up on.

[0:50:50 - 0:50:51]: But anyway, you can just text.

[0:50:55 - 0:50:57]: But iPhone mirror from where.

[0:50:58 - 0:51:00]: Now I need to join the meeting right from my iPhone then.

[0:51:01 - 0:51:01]: No.

[0:51:03 - 0:51:06]: Yeah, we know because you're showing the whole screen.

[0:51:09 - 0:51:12]: It's a new app on like native to.

[0:51:14 - 0:51:15]: iPhone mirroring.

[0:51:15 - 0:51:16]: Do you not have it?

[0:51:17 - 0:51:18]: No.

[0:51:18 - 0:51:19]: My computers are older.

[0:51:20 - 0:51:21]: That's true.

[0:51:23 - 0:51:23]: It's quite cool.

[0:51:23 - 0:51:28]: Like I don't know if you like I used to use like quick time.

[0:51:28 - 0:51:32]: If I was like demoing something on my phone, I would have to like.

[0:51:33 - 0:51:36]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, the whole thing where you like shows create like.

[0:51:37 - 0:51:37]: But.

[0:51:38 - 0:51:43]: And now there's an automatic app that basically just uses.

[0:51:43 - 0:51:44]: I think.

[0:51:45 - 0:51:46]: Airplay or whatever.

[0:51:47 - 0:51:50]: To show what your phone is.

[0:51:51 - 0:51:54]: It's just a lot just FYI that's like much nicer now.

[0:51:55 - 0:51:56]: But it seems like I don't have it.

[0:51:59 - 0:52:00]: You don't have to do it now.

[0:52:00 - 0:52:02]: Yeah, it's like very.

[0:52:02 - 0:52:03]: Yeah, exactly.

[0:52:03 - 0:52:04]: That's what it looks like.

[0:52:04 - 0:52:05]: And it's like Apple's own app.

[0:52:07 - 0:52:08]: Yeah, so it works very well.

[0:52:10 - 0:52:10]: But it's.

[0:52:11 - 0:52:14]: Anyway, I don't know because I sort of unhaven iPhone.

[0:52:15 - 0:52:17]: What I or is it does it work for the old ones because here it says.

[0:52:19 - 0:52:20]: Oh, I don't know.

[0:52:20 - 0:52:21]: iPhone 17 or whatever.

[0:52:21 - 0:52:21]: I don't know.

[0:52:22 - 0:52:24]: 15 or oh, it has to be 15 or later.

[0:52:24 - 0:52:24]: Also, yeah.

[0:52:26 - 0:52:26]: Yeah, so I don't.

[0:52:26 - 0:52:28]: Yeah, so I think basically that's.

[0:52:29 - 0:52:30]: I'll see if I can get it.

[0:52:30 - 0:52:34]: But so basically you can see here these are the historical ones.

[0:52:34 - 0:52:36]: So like I basically see my phone number.

[0:52:37 - 0:52:38]: Not so I'm a user.

[0:52:38 - 0:52:42]: So on the user table, we can see there was two different days that I.

[0:52:44 - 0:52:45]: Can I buy it?

[0:52:47 - 0:52:47]: Do I.

[0:52:47 - 0:52:49]: And you can try it.

[0:52:49 - 0:52:52]: No, you can't try it because well here, let's see.

[0:52:52 - 0:52:53]: So I'm Twilio.

[0:52:55 - 0:52:57]: Oh, because you have to add me as a user first.

[0:52:57 - 0:52:59]: No, I actually don't think so.

[0:52:59 - 0:53:00]: You need to just you need to.

[0:53:02 - 0:53:04]: Just message this phone over.

[0:53:05 - 0:53:08]: There's a specific you need to join the sandbox.

[0:53:08 - 0:53:08]: So hold on.

[0:53:14 - 0:53:15]: I don't know.

[0:53:32 - 0:53:34]: I don't think it's going to work.

[0:53:34 - 0:53:35]: So I think it's at a place.

[0:53:35 - 0:53:37]: So see this number.

[0:53:37 - 0:53:40]: You need to message this number and join voice.

[0:53:40 - 0:53:47]: voice. So let me try. Okay, what do I call this? What do you call it again?

[0:53:47 - 0:53:56]: To William. Oh, but like what is this project? Oh, health tracker MVP.

[0:53:56 - 0:54:04]: And then I can add via QR code. We'll see if that works. That'll be faster.

[0:54:10 - 0:54:23]: Oh. Okay. So I've messaged it. Join voice slow. Okay. So now what do I message it that it works?

[0:54:23 - 0:54:32]: Say I ran five miles. The thing is it might not. It might need a new refresh.

[0:54:32 - 0:54:35]: That's like you are all set the Sandbeck's Canal Center received messages.

[0:54:35 - 0:54:40]: Yeah. And then it says exercise log type running distance five mile.

[0:54:40 - 0:54:44]: Keep up the good work. Okay. So then let's see. Oh, yeah, we see you here, right?

[0:54:44 - 0:54:50]: So we see you here. I ran five miles. Oh, you didn't have any food logs and you didn't have.

[0:54:50 - 0:54:58]: Like you're here as a user. Okay. So I got this to work. The thing is, by the way,

[0:54:58 - 0:55:06]: right now, basically because I don't I'm not paying more for tokens. It's actually not.

[0:55:06 - 0:55:14]: It's sending it to open API. But then it's telling the open API is being like, you don't have any credits.

[0:55:15 - 0:55:18]: So what it's doing is it's using a default.

[0:55:20 - 0:55:25]: So basically, see, because your message had if it has ran jog workout gym walked

[0:55:27 - 0:55:32]: or like then it's going to understand how to parse it and put it in.

[0:55:32 - 0:55:39]: And the same for food, a food dinner is like these messages. It's going to understand and be able to

[0:55:39 - 0:55:47]: parse them. If the open API, I will pay a put credits, but I just, because I also want to be

[0:55:47 - 0:55:52]: able to do this with a voice message. It's just that I wanted to get to get the rest of the

[0:55:52 - 0:55:56]: rhetoric to work first because I don't always done the tests like the keys.

[0:55:58 - 0:56:03]: So because basically then it's going to send it like this is the message and extract the following

[0:56:03 - 0:56:09]: information and send it back. And so like if it's sending it to open API,

[0:56:09 - 0:56:13]: obviously, it's going to understand many more. Yes.

[0:56:13 - 0:56:18]: Terms. So what happens if I text it a term that it doesn't understand?

[0:56:20 - 0:56:22]: You know, I guess we'll get whatever the

[0:56:24 - 0:56:28]: well, open API is going to understand. If you texted something that it's not going to understand now

[0:56:28 - 0:56:35]: and it's not sending to open API, then the message is like, well, I can try. Here's a message

[0:56:35 - 0:56:39]: that you probably won't understand. Let's see what that yeah. So it sends like I can't understand

[0:56:39 - 0:56:44]: what you're saying. I'm not sure what you meant. Please send a message about it.

[0:56:44 - 0:56:47]: But your exercise food or type status for a report. Oh, cool.

[0:56:47 - 0:56:51]: And then you can send status and it should work as well.

[0:56:52 - 0:56:59]: Oh, so cool. Okay, so that's this part. But then I was like, okay, before I figure out this

[0:56:59 - 0:57:06]: like open API part and it's okay, cool, it's working on air table. Let me try to, so if you remember,

[0:57:06 - 0:57:15]: we had this level bowl UI. That was nice. And I was like, I want to take this and I want to

[0:57:15 - 0:57:23]: create connected to the level bowl UI. So basically, right, like I would want to come in here and see

[0:57:23 - 0:57:32]: all the logs of what I had sent as a user. So I downloaded the repo from level bowl.

[0:57:34 - 0:57:40]: And here we have the whole repo here. So this is this health buddy log. And then using

[0:57:40 - 0:57:49]: Clawed's help. I, you can see here, but basically, I was like connecting health tracker to health

[0:57:49 - 0:57:54]: buddy log UI. So it's like, I'd like to connect the health tracker app functionality to the health

[0:57:54 - 0:57:58]: buddy log UI. I'd like a person to be able to send a WhatsApp message to the Twilio number and

[0:57:58 - 0:58:02]: then log in and view their information on health buddy. I'm not an developer. Like, what's the

[0:58:02 - 0:58:11]: easiest way to make this work? You send cursor. And I uploaded here to the projects both of the

[0:58:11 - 0:58:16]: repos. So we could see both. Which that by the way, I don't know if you could do in cursor,

[0:58:16 - 0:58:22]: because if you can see here, it's to this two separate projects. So basically, it's seeing like you

[0:58:22 - 0:58:27]: have a, you know, backend, no JS application. And then I also have a React front end UI.

[0:58:28 - 0:58:35]: Thank you. Can. Because I think you can actually connect an entire rep like folder.

[0:58:36 - 0:58:40]: But I can connect an entire like, if I'm here, can I chat about another one?

[0:58:42 - 0:58:48]: Yeah, you can add a full. So I mean, it says one of the options for context is a folder. So I

[0:58:48 - 0:58:57]: assume you could just choose that whole folder. Cool. You know, so maybe it's, maybe it's possible. So here,

[0:59:01 - 0:59:08]: let's see, we ended up going. But yeah, I do think that this is probably where

[0:59:09 - 0:59:13]: cursor right now is a little bit more limited. It is like when there's lots of context.

[0:59:14 - 0:59:20]: Yeah. So I don't know though, maybe not. It's just that's my guess for now.

[0:59:21 - 0:59:27]: So here basically the biggest change that gave me was basically I need to set up a back end

[0:59:27 - 0:59:32]: server with APIs, right? Because I need to have API basically my back end needs to have APIs

[0:59:32 - 0:59:39]: descent to the front end of the information. Yeah. So in my backend project, I now have

[0:59:39 - 0:59:58]: a roots. So I have an API. JS. So here. So here. So I now have, I now have an API that can send

[0:59:58 - 1:00:07]: the different compulsion. Okay, great. And by the way, I haven't gotten this to completely work

[1:00:08 - 1:00:11]: yet. But I'm close. So I assume next week when I have more time, I'll get it to like,

[1:00:11 - 1:00:15]: because I kept on the issue with caught, right? I keep on like maxing out.

[1:00:17 - 1:00:21]: And then so we also wanted to be able to get like the last message from

[1:00:23 - 1:00:29]: in the air table service, like get the last messages. And then we also created an API service inside.

[1:00:29 - 1:00:34]: Right. So this is what came from loveable. So we created an API service. That's

[1:00:35 - 1:00:37]: the

[1:00:37 - 1:00:44]: information from from Heroku through Heroku. So I have an API. So here, so this is my API service.

[1:00:45 - 1:00:50]: So I have this and I had to create a lot of it. Kaden, Auth file, create and update this.

[1:00:50 - 1:00:53]: Like I had to create lots of different points.

[1:00:53 - 1:00:54]: You see that?

[1:00:54 - 1:00:59]: Ten you create like lots of different stuff. And basically I also had to update

[1:00:59 - 1:01:05]: all if you think the loveable project was using mock data. And so like everything had to be updated,

[1:01:05 - 1:01:08]: right? The dashboard page had to be updated to use information from the API.

[1:01:09 - 1:01:14]: So right? So here, you can see like it's pulling from the API and not to not to use it,

[1:01:14 - 1:01:20]: use mock data. And so the reports page and the back and forth here in questions. And so

[1:01:21 - 1:01:32]: so cool. So then also, but then, okay, so we went through all of that. Lots of errors and

[1:01:32 - 1:01:39]: back and forths and the usual. And here I give it because like the API, I said, I gave it the

[1:01:39 - 1:01:50]: link to put in. Okay. Back and forths here. And so now basically my my back end now has API

[1:01:50 - 1:01:59]: routes for the login health data and messages. But then I was like, how do I see the front?

[1:02:00 - 1:02:08]: How do I see the front end? And so I actually uploaded to get hub pages.

[1:02:10 - 1:02:16]: So I have a GitHub page. Do you see here? I run the spread because it's like not working. But

[1:02:17 - 1:02:25]: so we're on a personal GitHub and there's now a health buddy log UI. And this one, so like when I first

[1:02:25 - 1:02:37]: logged into it, okay, I did have, I think it's maybe off. No, I don't remember. I need to

[1:02:38 - 1:02:43]: basically when you first get to the page, you have to put in your cell number, right? So I put

[1:02:43 - 1:02:50]: in my cell number. And so like now it's not working, but I am on my C here. Like I know it's

[1:02:50 - 1:02:54]: missile numbers. So this is a study to figure out. And like this will need to get deleted because it's

[1:02:54 - 1:03:01]: no longer. Yeah. But in the beginning, by the way, I didn't, I wasn't able to like log in. So I

[1:03:01 - 1:03:05]: was part of the work I had to do was to actually log in. And now I have some error that I haven't

[1:03:05 - 1:03:13]: yet been able to debug. But then essentially I should be able to see, come in here, log in with

[1:03:13 - 1:03:21]: my number and see my what's up and see my report. Wow. By the way, I'll put in GitHub pages was super

[1:03:21 - 1:03:28]: easy. Like this is essentially I had to in my package, Jason, like add this code, install this and

[1:03:28 - 1:03:37]: then run. Like that's it. And then page was created. So like here. Yeah. I think GitHub pages is like

[1:03:39 - 1:03:47]: do you or L though then says you're gonna have page right? Yes. Yeah. But also like for our

[1:03:47 - 1:03:55]: purposes, it probably doesn't really matter. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And then you feel like I think

[1:03:56 - 1:04:03]: we would have to then figure out. I don't know how. But like we have a domain. So theoretically,

[1:04:03 - 1:04:11]: you could also have all of these pages exist in I don't know how subdomains work, but potentially

[1:04:11 - 1:04:19]: could be like health tracker dot let's talk AI tools.com. Yeah. And all of your stuff lives on that

[1:04:19 - 1:04:26]: subdomain. I mean, we own it. So I don't really, but I have no idea how subdomains work and I don't

[1:04:26 - 1:04:43]: know. That's a play specifically to a page like that. Yeah. And so yeah. So here we sit you see

[1:04:43 - 1:04:50]: here. So it was like configure it. So I just did that. So that was again. So I had to change some

[1:04:50 - 1:04:57]: stuff in the codes because we were using GitHub pages. And so I was in see here, there's like stuff

[1:04:57 - 1:05:02]: that had to happen. But that was fairly simple. And now there is a page. Yeah. It exists.

[1:05:05 - 1:05:11]: And then here I had errors around that. I think the last thing is the fact that

[1:05:14 - 1:05:27]: I wanted to be able to like log log and deploy. Okay. So basically, so I now have right. So there's this site.

[1:05:30 - 1:05:40]: And it's connected to my API. And so I should be able to refresh and see all the data appear.

[1:05:41 - 1:05:44]: Oh, this is this was the login numbers in the beginning. You could say I tried to log log in page.

[1:05:45 - 1:05:49]: I tried to log in. So the funny thing is like, I don't think I have a log out button, right? So like,

[1:05:49 - 1:05:55]: that's the amount in that is my number. But those are things to fix the once it's working. Okay.

[1:05:55 - 1:06:01]: I did have a log number and I signed in. There was an issue. So we fixed that. And then I was able to

[1:06:01 - 1:06:07]: sign in. And now we still have the issue that the information just isn't syncing. So I think that's

[1:06:07 - 1:06:17]: the second needs to be debugged. I just ran out yesterday of credits. But once that's working

[1:06:17 - 1:06:21]: essentially, then the information would appear here. And then I need to do stuff like putting a log

[1:06:21 - 1:06:26]: out right to like then you could sign in too. And again, like I didn't change anything here. So like,

[1:06:26 - 1:06:33]: this thing is like irrelevant, right? When it's actually live. Like this was for the demo.

[1:06:34 - 1:06:40]: Right. That would need to come off the. Yes. Although I suppose theoretically, maybe you want to be

[1:06:40 - 1:06:48]: able to add stuff here. But I think something else here. Yeah. Like not animated, like just chat from

[1:06:48 - 1:06:54]: there instead. But yeah. So I mean, this is just I would just like to get it to work just

[1:06:54 - 1:06:58]: because to see that it can happen. And then I also want to try to connect it then to the

[1:06:59 - 1:07:05]: open API. Like, yeah, we could see that it's like actually can understand stuff. And again,

[1:07:05 - 1:07:10]: it might MVP for the messages and basically I'm only handing exercise in food right now.

[1:07:10 - 1:07:14]: Right. I'm not handling anything else. I think that part's actually probably pretty easy to

[1:07:15 - 1:07:25]: add. So cool. I need credit back at and an API. Yeah, but I think this is not working yet. So

[1:07:25 - 1:07:30]: if like once it's working, I'll feel like it's like, yeah, the MVP part is great. And still,

[1:07:30 - 1:07:38]: though, like I guess it's though, you know, based on an data and an air table, which that's fine,

[1:07:38 - 1:07:47]: though. Yeah. Yeah. For sure for an MVP is like fine. Honestly, the like dirty little secret for

[1:07:47 - 1:07:53]: like our going Mary acquisition, is that all the first scholarships data lived on air table.

[1:07:53 - 1:07:59]: We had an insane air table bill. It was like $10,000 a month or something. It's like,

[1:08:02 - 1:08:09]: I can't believe we scaled to the size that we were having everything live on air table. It was

[1:08:09 - 1:08:17]: always like very risky and we always get off of it. But like people run like full business on

[1:08:17 - 1:08:21]: air table. Yeah. That makes sense because they also have the paid version and stuff like that.

[1:08:22 - 1:08:27]: I have to come in here and like to get the API to work right like every field had to be the right

[1:08:28 - 1:08:38]: type format. Yeah. And like to have that all like defined. But yeah, I think what was for me,

[1:08:38 - 1:08:41]: what was really cool was actually being, but like, okay, that's it. I use level one. I get a UI that I

[1:08:41 - 1:08:48]: like. Then I can actually connect to a package, right? Yeah. Which is very cool. Yeah. So then it

[1:08:48 - 1:08:55]: comes out of just being a prototype, but actually into something that someone can really try out.

[1:08:55 - 1:08:57]: Right? Because I think there's always a thing. Yeah, we're showing me a demo.

[1:08:58 - 1:09:05]: So like it's nice. It's a demo, right? So it's like actually being able to just get like, I

[1:09:05 - 1:09:09]: feel like it saved the work of like having to need a designer to design the UI, right? So now it's

[1:09:09 - 1:09:15]: like, oh, I like this. So let's connect my MVP that I did with the WhatsApp to this UI. Yeah.

[1:09:15 - 1:09:20]: Yeah. And yeah. And because it's super simple, right? Only food and

[1:09:20 - 1:09:22]: exodus. And I feel like also that API was fairly simple.

[1:09:24 - 1:09:25]: Still, I'm impressed that the whole.

[1:09:26 - 1:09:33]: What's even cool that I was able to do that whole like WhatsApp thing, you know? Yeah.

[1:09:35 - 1:09:40]: And that works super seamlessly. Yeah. I mean, well, the last because that's the last week,

[1:09:40 - 1:09:43]: I dealt with that. Right? If you remember, I did not work super seamlessly because I started

[1:09:43 - 1:09:51]: on a lifetime trying to get it to connect to Google Sheets. Yeah. But yeah. And so basically,

[1:09:53 - 1:09:58]: this, yeah, this, I mean, it's in the sandbox, but like you can see here. So this is when a message

[1:09:58 - 1:10:06]: comes in, it sends a webhook to the API. Once you're done with this project, which I know will be

[1:10:06 - 1:10:12]: like a few weeks or whatever, or like, yeah, you should definitely do like a deep dive blog post on it.

[1:10:13 - 1:10:17]: Because that's cool. I also think like I don't know now because I'm not paying for opening

[1:10:17 - 1:10:22]: out the voices working. I think it's not like I want I want to be able to send a voice message

[1:10:22 - 1:10:26]: to WhatsApp, right? Because that was like, yeah, yeah, yeah. So like, let's see. It might, but

[1:10:28 - 1:10:33]: technically it should because Chachi PT can handle voice, but like, I don't know if the way I've

[1:10:33 - 1:10:41]: said it, I can handle it. So like, that's also once I get this UI to work, then the speech thing also,

[1:10:43 - 1:10:48]: like I, one of the options, because remember, I tried Google and then Azure and then,

[1:10:50 - 1:10:54]: which also by the way, if you can figure out a Zor, theoretically, you use Azure, because now we have

[1:10:54 - 1:11:02]: that like 500,000, yeah, and minutes a month, but you're not going to touch. Yeah, characters,

[1:11:02 - 1:11:08]: I think, or whatever. We're not, we wouldn't touch it. Yeah. And, but one of the other options was

[1:11:08 - 1:11:14]: OpenAI, but it was cheap because I asked that how much money it would cost.

[1:11:14 - 1:11:21]: Oh, it would cost. Okay. So maybe a little more, once I put in credits. Yeah. Okay. But like,

[1:11:22 - 1:11:29]: also you can ask how much of things it would cost. Yeah. No, and I can try it out for my tests,

[1:11:29 - 1:11:33]: right? So like I can see how much it costs when I send it, right? I, before like, I ran

[1:11:33 - 1:11:39]: five miles just to like, yeah, because I was kind of like, I mean, I was at the high end, because I was

[1:11:39 - 1:11:45]: like, a van and I both use this. I was like, if we did this for an hour every day, like, and this

[1:11:45 - 1:11:49]: is the spreadsheet, like, it's spreadsheet, you like basically know how long I take, like,

[1:11:49 - 1:11:54]: how many words would that be and how much would it cost over a month? Yeah. And I don't remember what

[1:11:54 - 1:12:00]: it said, but I was being cheap and didn't want to pay it. Yeah. It wasn't like $3. So that's what I was

[1:12:01 - 1:12:12]: up. Yeah. Yeah. It was more than I thought it would be. Yeah. Which makes sense. Yeah. Yeah.

[1:12:12 - 1:12:17]: So it's like, can be a work that they need to do. Yeah. But I was kind of like, if Microsoft

[1:12:17 - 1:12:22]: Azure is giving away this much for free, I was surprised that they would charge so much.

[1:12:22 - 1:12:31]: Yeah. Or that there wouldn't be tears where like the first X words are much cheaper or something.

[1:12:33 - 1:12:39]: Anyway, cool. Yeah. So hopefully next week I'll get that to work. I also next week need to do

[1:12:39 - 1:12:43]: because I didn't get to it this week, like the deep research for my boss.

[1:12:44 - 1:12:49]: Oh, I'm trying to do research for like hospital at home. Yeah.

[1:12:51 - 1:12:54]: But I want first I want to try to get this to work just because it would be cool.

[1:12:56 - 1:13:02]: I have a whole bunch of like other projects that I like I was away for four days this week.

[1:13:04 - 1:13:10]: But by the way, it was also so it was like a full day in Bersheva for like this. I'm

[1:13:10 - 1:13:15]: like an expert panel for a new indicator they want to do for like healthy neighborhoods.

[1:13:15 - 1:13:19]: Yes. You mentioned that. Oh, by the way, I'm in pause now because I think we're going to be.

[1:13:19 - 1:13:26]: But then it was crazy because they like, it's funny because today I was like, you should obviously

[1:13:26 - 1:13:29]: in a session like that it's her on a time of Western.
